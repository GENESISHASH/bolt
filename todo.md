### @todo
- [x] 1 enforce bolthash to produce sha256 like hex only outputs with same len (64)
  - [x] 1 rebuild node module and test
  - [x] 1 rebuild cli tool and test
  - [ ] 3 rebuild webasm library and test
    - this needs fixed, producing wrong hashes
- [ ] 1 `/blockahin` - make these libraries and primitives into a network node
  - [ ] 1 implement pvp sync
- [ ] 1 `/www/explorer/`: contains a react-based block explorer gui.
- [ ] 2 `/wallets/browser-extensionwallet/`: contains the chrome and firefox wallet extension.
- [ ] 3 `/www/homepage/`: contains the homepage for bolt.
