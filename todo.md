### @todo
- [x] enforce bolthash to produce sha256 like hex only outputs with same len (64)
  - [x] rebuild node module and test
  - [x] rebuild cli tool and test
  - [ ] rebuild webasm library and test
    - this needs fixed, producing wrong hashes
- [ ] `/blockchain` - make these libraries and primitives into a network node
  - [ 1 implement p2p sync
- [ ] `/www/explorer/`: contains a react-based block explorer gui.
- [ ] `/wallets/browser-extension-wallet/`: contains the chrome and firefox wallet extension.
